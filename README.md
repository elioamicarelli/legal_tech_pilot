# About this repo

In 2016 I have been in contact with a dutch legal tech start-up connected with the ARAG SE insurance company. The start-up had a general interest in exploring options to innovate the current procedures adopted by the ARAG SE group so they provided to me a heterogeneous sample of the data available in their database. 

For this consulting I built a pilot study demostrating the feasibility of automating the classification of legal questions submitted by ARAG's clients via the jurofoon.nl website. This led to the replacement of manual categorization of legal enquires with semiautomated procedures.

This repository only contain material the client agreed to share.

In this repository you will find the following items:

- pilot_report.pdf. The initial report of this project in pdf format

- pilot_report.Rmd. The initial report in R markdown allowing to replicate the analysis.

- data_clean.csv, xgbmodel.rda, xgbtrain.rda. Data needed to replicate the analysis using pilot_report.Rmd.

- README.md. This file.
